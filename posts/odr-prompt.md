_____

Use the best practices provided below and the intial context I shared to create a deep research prompt on the following topic:

Context:

______
Please build a prompt using the following guidelines:

Define the Objective: 
- Clearly state the main research question or task.
- Specify the desired outcome (e.g., detailed analysis, comparison, recommendations).

Gather Context and Background:
- Include all relevant background information, definitions, and data.
- Specify any boundaries (e.g., scope, timeframes, geographic limits).

Use Specific and Clear Language:
- Provide precise wording and define key terms.
- Avoid vague or ambiguous language.

Provide Step-by-Step Guidance:
- Break the task into sequential steps or sub-tasks.
- Organize instructions using bullet points or numbered lists.

Specify the Desired Output Format:
- Describe how the final answer should be organized (e.g., report format, headings, bullet points, citations).
Include any specific formatting requirements.

Balance Detail with Flexibility:
- Offer sufficient detail to guide the response while allowing room for creative elaboration.
- Avoid over-constraining the prompt to enable exploration of relevant nuances.

Incorporate Iterative Refinement:
- Build in a process to test the prompt and refine it based on initial outputs.
- Allow for follow-up instructions to adjust or expand the response as needed.

Apply Proven Techniques:
- Use methods such as chain-of-thought prompting (e.g., “think step by step”) for complex tasks.
- Encourage the AI to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps.

Set a Role or Perspective:
- Assign a specific role (e.g., “act as a market analyst” or “assume the perspective of a historian”) to tailor the tone and depth of the analysis.

Avoid Overloading the Prompt:
- Focus on one primary objective or break multiple questions into separate parts.
- Prevent overwhelming the prompt with too many distinct questions.

Request Justification and References:
- Instruct the AI to support its claims with evidence or to reference sources where possible.
- Enhance the credibility and verifiability of the response.

Review and Edit Thoroughly:
- Ensure the final prompt is clear, logically organized, and complete.
- Remove any ambiguous or redundant instructions.
